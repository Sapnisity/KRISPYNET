		<p>
			KRISPYNET is a one of a kind server curated by KEEZUS and hosted by Leafy. A server so small yet so big. The server is at 1.12.2 but still has a range of activities to do such as: Make buildings, nations, declare war, have fun with your friends etcetera. 
			
			KEEZUS and Leafy teamed up to create this so people who want to do something in their free time can sit down and chill online.
			
			Anyone is welcome to join the server as long as the rules are followed and met.
			
			Welcome to KRISPYNET.
